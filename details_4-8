4. Categorization of interphase A domains and TADs based on mitotic H3S10p levels (Fig. 2, S2)

Generation of bigwig files:
Using deeptools bamCoverage defaults (with --normalizeUsing RPGC --effectiveGenomeSize 2685511504)

Generation of bed files:
Using standard HOMER Hi-C analysis pipeline
TADs called using findTADsAndLoops.pl were used (Islam et al., 2023). Compartments were called in this study using HOMER runHiCpca.pl and findHiCCompartments.pl commands (from published HiC: Abramo et al., 2019).

Categorisation of A domains based on mitotic H3S10p signal:

Using deeptools multiBigwigSummary 

multiBigwigSummary BED-file --numberOfProcessors 3 --outFileName H3S10p_at_A_domains_matrix --bwfiles Asyn_H3S10p.bigwig Mit_H3S10p.bigwig --outRawCounts Mit_H3S10p_at_A_domains_score-file --BED A_domains.bed

A domains were sorted on the basis of decreasing Mit_H3S10p signal from the Mit_H3S10p_at_A_domains_score-file obtained from above code.
(Output 3 files: High-, medium- and low- Mit_H3S10p_at_A_domains) used for further analyses and plotting.

Categorisation of TADs based on mitotic H3S10p signal:
TADs were intersected with the three categories of A domains to obtain 3 output files:  High-, medium- and low- Mit_H3S10p_TADs. These were then used for further analyses and plotting.

5. Strength and activity calculation for A domains and TADs (Fig. 2, S2)

Bigwig files:
From ENCODE or NCBI GEO

Generation of score files:
multiBigwigSummary BED-file --numberOfProcessors 3 --outFileName <output> --bwfiles <insulation or histone modification bigwigs> --outRawCounts <score-file> --BED <A domain or TAD bed file>
Output files obtained were used for plotting using R.

6. Chromatin compaction in A domains and TADs (Fig. 4, S5)

A)	APA plots (for TADs)

Generation of .mcool files:
.hic files were downloaded from 4DN and converted to .mcool files

Generation of APA plots:

coolpup.py asyn_25kb.cool <respective-TAD file> --nshifts 10 --rescale --local --unbalanced --coverage_norm --rescale_size 87 --outname <respective-output file>

plotpup.py mit_25kb_high_mit_s10p_hg38 mit_25kb_low_mit_s10p_hg38 mit_25kb_high_mit_ac_hg38 mit_25kb_low_mit_ac_hg38 mit_25kb_random_hg38 --n_cols 5 --col_names highs,lows,higha,lowa,ran --cmap 'Oranges' --scale log --enrichment 0 --dpi 600 --output APA-plot

B)	Log2DLR plots (for TADs and A domains)

Generation of .DLR.bedGraph files:
Using standard HOMER Hi-C analysis pipeline; particularly, using the TagDir files to calculate the distal-to-local log2 ratio (DLR)

Used the .bedGraph files as bigwig for multiBiwigSummary with TADs and A domains as input .bed files
Output files obtained were used for plotting using R.

C)	H3 levels (for A domains)

multiBigwigSummary BED-file --numberOfProcessors 3 --outFileName H3_at_A_domains.matrix --bwfiles <H3 bigwigs in S, A and D lines> --outRawCounts H3_at_A_domains-score-file --BED <A domain bed file>
Output files obtained were used for plotting using R.


7. Analysis and visualisation of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq

Generation of heatmaps matrix files:
Using deepTools computeMatrix

Categorisation and scoring:
Using deepTools multiBigwigSummary or bedtools map

Visualization:
Using deepTools plotProfile and plotHeatmap
Using R ggplot

8. Chromosome compaction in metaphase spreads (Fig. 4)

Metaphase spread .tiff files were cropped with a standard rectangular ROI (region of interest) such that each rectangle had chromosomes dropped from a single mitotic cell. The individual images were processed in imageJ and DAPI channel was binarised. This was followed by %Area calculation for each ROI. The inverse of %Area was used as a proxy for chromosome compaction of a single metaphase spread. 10 such spreads were taken from each replicate for each line.
