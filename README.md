# Meel et al., 2024: Mitotic compaction of active domains and promoters by H3S10 phosphorylation preserves chromatin structure and function in interphase
Abstract: Mitotic chromosomes lose interphase-specific genome organization and transcription but gain histone phosphorylation, specifically H3S10p. This phosphorylation event compacts chromosomes in early mitosis by reducing inter-nucleosomal distance before the loading of condensin. However, it is unclear if H3S10p in mitosis preserves the identity of lost chromatin domains and promoters, physically and functionally. Here, using the pre-mitotic expression of histone H3S10 and its mutants H3S10A and H3S10D, we show that H3S10p hyper-phosphorylates active promoters and spreads into active (A) domains in mitosis, causing compaction of these regions. By spreading into active domains in mitosis, in the absence of the interphase-specific genome organization, H3S10p physically retains the active domainsâ€™ identity. Functionally, H3S10p ensures optimal closing of promoters by stabilizing the nucleosomes, thereby protecting them from excess transcription post-mitosis. In the H3S10 non-phospho-mutants, these chromatin regions fail to close properly during mitosis. As a result, they exhibit enhanced accessibility and transcription of active genes in the next interphase. We propose that spreading of mitotic H3S10p into active domains preserves their identity during mitosis and, acts as a rheostat to fine-tune transcription and chromatin domain re-formation in the subsequent interphase.
